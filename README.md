## Objective

We would like you to create a small app powered by React and
Redux with a 2-column layout with a list of people on the left
and a form to edit a specific person on the right. The left
column should be 200px wide and the right column should fill
up the remaining width. There should be a select component
to filter the list of people by “favoriteFruit”. The list of
people should be sorted by name. Selecting a person on the left
should show the person’s data in the form on the right. Updating
form fields should update the store. We have included a large
list of people in the store, for you to use.

## Get Started

First run `npm install` then then run `npm start` to get started.
